# 2020-Intern-Pharmaceutical-Company
 This includes what I have done for 2020 summer intern at a pharmaceutical company.

I worked as a statistical programmer at department of clinical development, Dizal Pharma, Beijing, China, from June to September.

During this period, I derived several SDTM and ADaM dataset and created “Demographics and Baseline Characters” and “Adverse Events” related forms for projects in this company. Also, I tried to make good use of the combination of R and SAS to show “Exposure-Response Relationship” visually. Thus, I produced my own codes for organizations departmental manuals for future use.
